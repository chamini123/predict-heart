# Heart disease prediction web application

> This application predicts the presence of heart disease in a patient using an underlying supervised machine learning classification model.
> It considers patient's different test parameters and predicts a binary response [Normal, Heart Disease].
> The model was trained on a publicly available dataset after comparing different models on the basis of accuracy score and hyperparameter tuning.
> The data was preprocessed (feature selection) before feeding in the model.  
> Dataset: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci)
